TinyPICO MicroPython Firmware
=============================

In this folder you'll find 2 versions of the TinyPICO MicroPython firmware:

micropython-tinypico-1.11.bin - Is built with IDF3 and is the firmware I ship on TinyPICO production boards.

micropython-tinypico-1.12.bin - Is built with IDF4.1 and is the bleeding edge version as of March 15th, 2020.

All TinyPICO firmware here includes both the TinyPICO Helper and Dotstar libraries frozen into the firmware.

You are able to download MicroPython TinyPICO specific firmware from http://micropython.org/download, but there is currently a build issue preventing the TinyPICO Helper and Dotstar libraries from being included as frozen modules :(
